    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>1 quart canola oil</li>
       <li>1 cup AP flour</li>
       <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
       <li>1 cup Italian seasoned breadcrumbs</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Step 1:</em> Pour oil to a depth of 2 inches in a large Dutch oven. Heat oil over medium heat to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). </li>
        <li><em>Step 2:</em> While oil heats, set out 3 wide shallow bowls. Fill them individually with flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li><em>Step 3:</em> Working with a handful of bites at a time, gently dredge cheese in flour, and shake off excess. Dip in eggs; let excess drip off. Dredge in breadcrumbs to coat. Place on a small rimmed baking sheet or large plate. Transfer to freezer for 15 minutes. </li>
        <li><em>Step 4:</em> Fry boursin bites in batches, cooking until golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Set on paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining bites. Transfer to a platter and serve immediately.</li>
